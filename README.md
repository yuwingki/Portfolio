# Portfolio
blogging of my projects and activities

# [Project 1: Children Hospital Health Dashboard](https://github.com/yuwingki/Children-Hospital-Dashboard)
* created a data pipelines to clean up the data for EAD
* built a patient personal cardiovascular health dashboard

# [Project 2: Kaggle Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/yuwingki/House-Prices)
* first school project doing Regression Analysis using R

# [Project 3: Java Programming 8th by Joyce Farrell Exercises](https://github.com/yuwingki/Java-Programming-8th-Ex)
This is a compilation of the solutions written to the programming exercises found in the book. The exercises cover topics such as variables, classes, objects, control-flow statements, and basic Java syntax. At the end of practices, I was able to:
* Describe the role of data structures and algorithms in programming.
* Describe basic data types and more evolved structures in which data can be stored.
* Recognize examples where specific data structures are suited for solving specific types of programming problems.
* Be familiar with a number of important computer algorithms using those structures.
* Understand how to implement data structures and algorithms using different techniques.
* Convert a business process into the data structures and algorithms required to model it.

I will be updating here to talk about projects that cover classification, regression, clustering, and deep learning.

* Here is the [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aXk2RViq3c) that has provided me with a lot of help in building the foundation for my portfolio. I definitely recommend their channel. Aside from building a portfolio, it also gave helpful and up-to-date tips for becoming a successful data scientist.
